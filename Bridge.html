								The Second Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge is a bridge across 
								the Yangtze River in Wuhan, Hubei province, China. It is located 
								northeast (downstream) of the historic central area of the city's Hankou 
								District and is the northern crossing for the Inner Ring Road. 
								It is a cable-stayed bridge built of pre-stressed concrete, has a 
								central span of 400 metres (1,300 ft). It is 4.678 kilometres (2.907 mi) in 
								length (including the 1,876-metre (6,155 ft) main span) and is 26 metres 
								(85 ft) wide. Its main bridgeheads are 90 metres (300 ft) high each, 
								pulling 392 thick slanting cables together in the shape of double fans, so 
								that the central span of the bridge is well-balanced on the piers and the 
								bridge's stability and vibration resistance are ensured.

								The Wuhan Yangtze Great Bridge, commonly known as Wuhan First Yangtze 
								Bridge, is a double-deck road and rail bridge across the Yangtze River 
								in Wuhan, in Central China. At its completion in 1957, the bridge was 
								the easternmost crossing of the Yangtze, and was often referred to as 
								the "First Bridge of the Yangtze".The bridge extends 1.6 kilometers (1 mile) from 
								Turtle Hill in Hanyang, on the northern bank of the Yangtze, 
								to Snake Hill in Wuchang, on the southern bank of the Yangtze. Plans 
								for the bridge's construction were first made in 1910. A total of four 
								exploratory surveys were made between 1913 and 1948 to identify 
								a suitable site, but economic limitations and the combination of
								World War II and the Chinese Civil War prevented the bridge's building until 
								the 1950s. Actual construction began in September 1955 and was completed in 
								October 1957

								The Qingchuan Bridge is an arch bridge located in Wuhan, 
								People's Republic of China. It is the fourth bridge on the Han 
								River, the third motorway bridge (provisional name 
								being "Third Jianghan Bridge") and also the "Rainbow Bridge" due 
								to its shape and red color. The bridge has a span of 280 m (919 ft),
								with a full length of 989.75 m (3,247.2 ft). The construction of this
								bridge begins on Dec 20, 1997, and completed in 2000, which
								started revenue service to the public. It has four lanes, connects 
								Yanhe Ave in Hankou with Hannan Rd in Hanyang.[1] It used to be a tolled bridge, 
								but after the implementation of electronic toll collection in Wuhan, 
								the toll plaza was razed.
