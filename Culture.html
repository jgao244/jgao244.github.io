								Wuhan is the capital of Hubei Province in China. 
								It is the largest city in Hubei and the most populous city in Central China, 
								with a population of over 11 million,
								the ninth-most populous Chinese city and one of the nine National 
								Central Cities of China. The name "Wuhan" came from the city's historical 
								origin from the conglomeration of Wuchang, 
								Hankou and Hanyang, which are collectively known as the "Three Towns of Wuhan". 
								It lies in the eastern Jianghan Plain, at the confluence of the Yangtze river 
								and its largest tributary, the Han River and is known as "Nine Provinces' Thoroughfare".
								The name "Wuhan" is a portmanteau of the two major cities on the northern and southern 
								banks of the Yangtze River that make up the Wuhan metropolis: 
								"Wu" refers to the city of Wuchang, which lies on the southern bank of the Yangtze, 
								while "Han" refers to the city of Hankou, which lies on the northern bank of the Yangtze.
